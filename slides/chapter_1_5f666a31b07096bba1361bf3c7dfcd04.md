Implied volatility is the estimated volatility of security’s price and is most commonly used when pricing options. In general, implied volatility increases while the market is bearish, when investors believe the asset’s price will decline over time, and decreases when the market is bullish, when investors believe that the price will rise over time. Implied volatility is a way of estimating the future fluctuations of a security’s worth based on certain predictive factors.
